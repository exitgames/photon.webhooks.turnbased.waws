## Run it locally

- Open the sample running Visual Studio as administrator and build the project (admin privileges are required because a virtual directory is used).
- *Option 1: Azure Storage*, web.config `<add key="DataAccess" value="Azure"/>`
  - Select the Azure Storage > Manage Access Keys (copy paste into the config)
  - set `<add key="AzureAccountName" value="" />`
  - set `<add key="AzureAccountKey" value="" />`
- *Option 2: local Redis*, web.config `<add key="DataAccess" value="Redis"/>`
  - set `<add key="RedisPassword" value=""/>`
  - set `<add key="RedisUrl" value="127.0.0.1"/>`
  - Start local redis server
- Start ngrok in a command shell: `ngrok http 80` and copy the url which forwards to 127.0.0.1:80. (change port 80 to the listening port of your web server e.g. 5000 or else)
- go to the [Photon Dashboard](https://www.photonengine.com/Dashboard), create an application and set in the Webhooks tab the BaseUrl value: `[url from ngrok]/{AppId}`.
- run the client demo
- check the requests and responses in your browser at [127.0.0.1:4040](http://127.0.0.1:4040)


## Next Steps ##

### Publish to Azure Websites ###

- Create an [Microsoft Azure Websites account](http://aka.ms/exitgames_azure), create a website, load down a publisher profile and publish the side to Azure Websites. Don't forget to change the Redis settings to point to your Redis server (you can use your local server by forwarding the corresponding port with ngrok to your PC)
- adjust the base url in the Photon Dashboard
